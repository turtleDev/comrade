1) we're going to use the shell command 'ping' on linux and the inbuilt command
   'ping' on windows cmdline.
2) first step is to implement a linux implementation. Hopefully add someway to
   configure it ( like specifying the website to be ping'd by default).
3) We'll be using libnotify on linux, and notifu for windows for notifications.
   (You'll have to create a wrapper for notifu, since it's written in C++ )
4) We'll use file locking, on both windows and linux, to make sure that only
   one instance runs at a time. for e.g. display another popup ( another 
   instance is running )
5) hopefully package it into a .deb and a .exe for window users.
6) Also, we'll add a timeout. When the program has run N minutes or say n 
   seconds, it will die.
7) Gorilla-audio for notification sound.
